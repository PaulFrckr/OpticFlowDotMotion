# OpticFlowDotMotion
## Motions for different component of optical flow using dots

Three different motions observed via optical flow: 
  - Translation
  - Rotation
  - Contraction/expansion (radial)
  
These 3 conditions can be displayed via the DotMotion function by so:

```
DotMotion(motion, direction, density, display time, [%dots with random motion])
```

This function includes the initialisation of the screen display.
It uses the PsychToolbox-3 available for download here: http://psychtoolbox.org/download.html
